	<h3>What Is The Steel Pan?</h3>
	
	<img id="pan" src="http://andrewsalamanca.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/web_steel_photo2-1.jpg"></img>
	
	
	<p>The steel pan is a percussion instrument made out of large, curved pieces of metal.  Hammered into the shiny metal surface of the steel pan is a series of dents.  Each dent creates a different note, subtly different from the ones around it, according to their position and size.  The steel pan is ofetn used in calypso music.  It can sometimes have a cruise ship mentality, people think of it as a happy summery sound from Trinidad and the Caribbean islands as a whole, but it is a lot more than that. It's got a very important history.</p>
	
	<h3>The History and Development of the Steel Pan</h3>
	
	
	<p>The steel pan originated in Trinidad and Tobago in the early 20th century.  During British Colonial rule in the late 1800's, hand drums were used as a call for neighborhood gangs to collect and 'mash up' (fight) with the other gangs.  Hoping to stop the violence, the government outlawed hand drums in 1886.  After the hand drums were outlawed, the Trini musicians began forming bands called Tamboo Bamboo.

	<p> Each member of the group would carry a bamboo stick and pound it on the ground as they paraded through the streets, making different rhythms that were different in each neighborhood. The government outlawed the bamboo bands as well.  <br> <br> With no drums, the musicians of the local neighborhoods tapped on whatever they could find, things like milk cans, paint buckets, old car parts, and empty oil barrels from the US Navy bases on the island.</p>


	<p>Using these instruments, the neighborhood bands came together again and marched down the streets playing the same rhythms as before.  These groups came to be called the "Iron Band".  The person who was first credited with putting the first musical note in the steel pan was Winston “Spree” Simon in the 1930’s when he tapped on a dent in his oil drum. <br> <br>  In the 1930's,   After people in the Iron Bands started experimenting with denting their metal instruments to produce different notes, Ellie Mannette was the first to flatten out a pan and give the steel pan it’s final image.  Many tuners began experimenting with producing actual music with tuned "pans", and formed large groups of pan players into orchestrated bands.</p>

	<p>When French planters arrived in Trinidad in the late 1700s they brought with them a tradition called carnival.  Their slaves formed their own festival, that was mainly drum music.  The musical competitions between steel pan groups, which began to take place each year at Carnival, quickly replaced the street fights that used to happen.  In 1963, the first official Panorama Steel Band Championship was held as part of the Trinidad's independence celebration.</p>
